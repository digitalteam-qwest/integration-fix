# intergration-fix
firmstep can't fix their site so i've done it myself (partially). i've created a little chrome extension which adds a url next to the button which actually opens the integration. the delete button is still broken though

## How to install
1. Download the files by clicking the '<> Code' button and then the 'Download ZIP' button.
2. Unzip the files
3. Go to chrome://extensions/ on Google Chrome
4. Turn on developer mode
5. Click load unpacked
6. Select the folder which have the unzipped files in them
