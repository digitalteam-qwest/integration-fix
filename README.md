# intergration-fix
firmstep can't fix their site so i've done it myself (partially). i've created a little chrome extension which adds a url next to the button which actually opens the integration. the delete button is still broken though

## How to install
1. Download the files
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ on Google Chrome
3. Turn on developer mode
4. Click load unpacked
5. Select the folder which have the downloaded files in them
